#Welcome;This tour explores a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing 4,000 PBMCs from 10X Genomics. It will focus on differences between two methods of calling cells - using the default method in the <i>CellRanger</i> software from 10X Genomics, or using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/234872"><i>emptyDrops</i> method</a>.<br/><br/><font color="##FF0000"><strong>NOTE:</strong></font> if the tour is not jumping to the correct UI elements, exit by clicking anywhere else on the app, and click on the top-right question mark to start a new tour.
#redDimPlot1;Here we have a t-SNE plot of the union of all called cells, coloured by the algorithm used to detect it. <br /><br /><strong>Action:</strong> please select the <i>emptyDrops</i>-only cluster on the far left.
#colDataPlot1;Here we have a series of violin plots, showing the log-total UMI count for all cells in each cluster. Only the cells in the selected cluster from <font color="#402ee8">Reduced dimension plot 1</font> are visible here, and have lower UMI counts than cells in the other clusters. This reflects the greater power of <i>emptyDrops</i> to detect cells with low RNA content.
#featAssayPlot1;Here are violin plots showing the expression of the <em>PF4</em> gene in the cells of each cluster. As before, only selected points from <font color="#402ee8">Reduced dimension plot 1</font> are visible here. These cells are clearly upregulating the <em>PF4</em> gene, relative to the other clusters. 
#rowStatTable1_annotation;What is <em>PF4</em>, you might ask? Looking up the Ensembl annotation reveals that it stands for platelet factor 4. <br /><br /><strong>Action:</strong> click on the link.
#heatMapPlot1;And in fact, there are some other platelet-relevant genes that are present in the set of upregulated genes for the chosen cluster (non-transparent bars, again based on the selection in <font color="#402ee8">Reduced dimension plot 1</font>). This includes pro-platelet basic protein (<em>PPBP</em>), serum deprivation response protein (<em>SDPR</em>) and thymosin beta 4 X-linked (<em>TMSB4X</em>).
#redDimPlot1;Returning to the t-SNE plot - let's examine the middle <i>emptyDrops</i>-majority cluster, at about (-25, 10). <br /><br /><strong>Action:</strong> please select the middle <i>emptyDrops</i>-majority cluster, using either a Shiny brush or lasso.
#colDataPlot1;Again, we see that the selected cells have lower total UMI counts than that of most other clusters. However, the question becomes, what do these cells represent?
#colDataPlot1_DataBoxOpen;<strong>Action:</strong> first, let's open this box.
#colDataPlot1_YAxis + .selectize-control;<strong>Action:</strong> change the y-axis to "pct_counts_Mito". This can be typed in manually if you can't see the options due to this box.
#colDataPlot1;You can see that most of the selected cells have elevated mitochondrial content, consistent with cell damage whereby mRNA leaks out of the cytoplasm (thus enriching for mitochondrial RNA).
#rowStatTable1;This is confirmed by having a look at the expression of mitochondrial genes. <br /><br /><strong>Action:</strong> Type "^MT-" in the search box to identify all genes from the mitochondrial genome.
#heatMapPlot1_FeatNameBoxOpen;<strong>Action:</strong> again, let's open this box.
#heatMapPlot1_FeatNameSource + .selectize-control;<strong>Action:</strong> Select "Row statistics table 1" here. 
#heatMapPlot1_Clear;<strong>Action:</strong> Clear out the existing features...
#heatMapPlot1_Import;<strong>Action:</strong> ... and import the mitochondrial features from the table. 
#heatMapPlot1;Examination of the new heatmap confirms the relative enrichment of mitochondrial transcripts in the selected cluster of cells (non-transparent bars).
#Conclusions;<i>emptyDrops</i> is designed to detect barcodes with expression profiles that differ significantly from the ambient pool, presumably due to the presence of a cell in the droplet. This avoids the use of a threshold on the total UMI count, allowing recovery of more cells from a single experiment.<br /><br />However, this is a double-edged sword, retaining cell types that would otherwise have been lost (platelets) but also low-quality damaged cells. Careful quality control downstream is recommended, especially on the mitochondrial content.
